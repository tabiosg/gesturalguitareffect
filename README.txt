Gesturally Controlled Guitar Sound Effects Board

This project developed a real-time signal-processing sound effects board tailored for musicians' live performances, utilizing microcontrollers to manipulate input signals for specific outputs.
The current implementation allows for tremolo, wah, and delay effects.

This project was made during the W24 semester for EECS 452.

Zip Content:

design/ contains all designs implemented in project.
    This is primarily focused on the 3D-housing info but also the soldered protoboard.
src/ has the source code.
    src/data_collection has the code which was used to collect data during milestone 1
        This was achieved by dumping debug information over serial and having a Python script
        snoop the line.
    fw/final/gesturalguitareffect has the final firmware code to be flashed on the Teensy.
    sim/ has the code to run the simulation, which is independent of real hardware.
2024-Team-1-final.pdf has the final project report.
2024-Team-1-poster.pdf has the poster used during the demo and expo.
