All of the code in data_collection/ was only used during milestone 1 to get more data. This is optional.
It worked by taking in the serial debug statements printed by the Teensy and plotting that data afterward.
This serial debug feature will not work perfectly with all the newest code changes to the firmware.

All of the code in src/final/gesturalguitareffect is what is needed to be flashed on the Arduino.
The accelerometer.h and potentiometer.h files are self-explanatory.
The guitareffects.h describes all of our possible effects in an enum.
delay.audiogestural.cpp, tremolo.audiogestural.cpp, and wah.audiogestural.cpp have the specific guitar effect implementations.
audiogestural.cpp and audiogestural.h list the generic functions for the custom AudioStream class.
gesturalguitareffect.ino has the main logic for collecting data in the loop(), used to update parameters.

Al of the code in sim/ is what is needed to run the sim.
