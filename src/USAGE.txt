To run the main project, flash the Teensy with the code in fw/.
The buttons are the following, with the brackets representing the parameters for guitar tilt and slider:
- Black is None
- Green is Tremolo [Rate/Depth]
- Red is Delay [Repetitions/Length]
- Yellow is Wah [Gain/Center]

When running the sim, the GUI itself is self-explanatory, allowing one to switch between different songs and
change the effects' parameters.
